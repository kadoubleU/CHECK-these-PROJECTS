# HTML/CSS Excercise
I learn HTML/CSS. In the course we learn some things about web designs rules like how to apply colors, fonts, shadows, whitespace and much more. So we worked with this ready build project Chair Shop Page. I apply some colors, shadows, fonts, whitespace, icons and etc. But the most important here is the responsive version of the page. I created one to make the page visually accessible for mobile devices.
